py-norpix-reader
================

Python reader for NorPix .seq movie files (as produced by e.g. StreamPix software). 

**NOTE:** This module is deprecated and I've ended development. Its functionality has been added to the more versatile and powerful (and better-maintained) [pims](https://github.com/soft-matter/pims) project. â€” *Nathan Keim, July 2015*
